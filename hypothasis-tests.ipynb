    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the statistical tests performed across all four indicators, we can rank the drivers of global news coverage by their correlation strength (Spearman's $\\rho$):\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Military Power:** Strongest predictor ($\\rho \\approx 0.65$, $p < 0.001$).\n",
    "2.  **Economic Wealth (GDP):** Strong predictor ($\\rho \\approx 0.61$, $p < 0.001$).\n",
    "3.  **State Fragility (FSI):** Moderate **negative** predictor ($\\rho \\approx -0.33$, $p < 0.001$).\n",
    "    * *Interpretation:* As fragility increases (country becomes more unstable), news coverage tends to **decrease**. This contradicts the \"if it bleeds, it leads\" assumption for country-level data.\n",
    "4.  **Democratic Status:** Weakest predictor ($\\rho \\approx 0.26$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Verdict: \"Power Bias\"\n",
    "The data strongly supports the **\"Power Bias\"** hypothesis over the \"Conflict Bias\" hypothesis.\n",
    "* Global news attention is primarily driven by **Hard Power** (Military and Economic strength).\n",
    "* **Stability** is preferred over Fragility: highly stable, powerful nations receive significantly more attention than fragile, conflict-prone states (unless those states are strategically important)."
