# DSA-210-project

# Introduction

In this project, I'm analyzing what factors can affect the official mentions-reports of a country. 

# Project Proposal 

This project aims to find out underlying factors of number countries' offical mentions. By combibining-analyzing relevant data sources together, I want to explore what contributes to countires'
reports by another countries.

# Data Sources To Be Used 

The main source of data is the 	Diplomatic text dataset from GlobalDiplomacyNet project (https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi%3A10.7910/DVN/HYJDE0)

Other sources that I want to combine with this dataset is 
1) GDP by country dataset --> planned to get from kaggle  (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rinichristy/countries-gdp-19602020)
2) Democracy index by country dataset -- > again from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shreyasur965/democracy-index)
3) Fragile States Index --> from Fragile States Index website ( https://fragilestatesindex.org/global-data/)

# Main Hypotheses To Be Tested

H1 : There is a relation between GDP of a country and number of mentions of country by other countries.

H2 : There is a relation between Democracy index of a country and number of mentions of country by other countries.

H3 : There is a relation between Fragile States Index of a country and number of mentions of country by other countries.

H4 : A country's entry into war increased that countries' mention number by another countries.
